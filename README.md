# React Three Fiber (R3F) Template

This template serves as a foundation for developing immersive 3D experiences using React and Three.js. Whether you're building interactive visualizations, games, or virtual reality applications, this template provides a structured starting point with essential dependencies and configurations.

## Introduction

React Three Fiber (R3F) is a powerful framework that brings the capabilities of Three.js, a JavaScript 3D library, into the world of React. By leveraging React's declarative and component-based approach, R3F simplifies the creation of complex 3D scenes while maintaining the flexibility and performance of Three.js.

## Features

### Seamless Integration

R3F seamlessly integrates Three.js into React components, allowing you to create interactive 3D scenes using familiar React patterns. This integration enables the composition of complex scenes with reusable components, facilitating code organization and maintainability.

### Comprehensive Dependencies

The template includes a comprehensive set of dependencies to enhance your development experience and streamline common tasks:

- **[@react-three/a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-three/a11y)**: Enhances accessibility of Three.js scenes in React applications.
- **[@react-three/drei](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-three/drei)**: Provides a collection of useful helpers and abstractions for R3F.
